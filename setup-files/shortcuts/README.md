I use several tools for text-expansion shortcuts
1. On desktop I used to use autokey - which is where the files (.json & txt) in the /Notion folder come from - but recently switched to espanso
    This switch is for various reasons: better support & wider usage, cross platform etc 

2. I also use web-text-expander on my chromebook, which can import shortcuts from a csv file
    I did really try to setup espanso on chromeos but could not get it to work (plus it would have only been within chromeos' crostini linux container - so wouldn't work with general chromebook apps)

Hence why I have python files to convert the shortcuts between these different representations
In future I'll update them to allow 2-way-sync between the yaml and csv files (since these are what I use)
