# synced-code repository

Welcome to my synced code repository, used as a place to store personal files so that I can access it from different computers and synchronise changes (google drive didn't cut it lol so I decided to use this instead)
	
> (for any university code/projects see [my UoM GitLab Page](https://gitlab.cs.man.ac.uk/n23551sf))

_full list of (my personal) coding rules can be found within the_ ***Coding Styleguide*** _in my Notion_
