# synced-code repository

Welcome to my synced code repository, used as a place to store code so that I can access it from different computers and synchronise changes (google drive didn't cut it lol so I decided to use this instead)

---

At the time of writing I barely know what I'm doing with git/github but look forward to using this alot once I have more experience and am comfortable using this, will try to maintain very good habits, i.e:

1. Regular, smaller commits instead of submitting an entire new project in a single commit
2. Descriptive commit messages meaning 
	1. A small single sentence title
	2. A longer description of changes (unless this is entirely evident from title)
3. Docmented, clean, idiomatic code
4. Tests within the code (or `doctests` in `julia` once I figure that out) 

_full list of coding rules can be found within the_ ***styleguide*** _in Notion_
