# synced_code repository

Welcome to my synced code repository, used as a place to store code so that I can access it from different computers and synchronise changes (google drive didn't cut it lol so I decided to use this instead)

At the time of writing I barely know what I'm doing with git/github but look forward to using this alot once I have more experience and am comfortable using this
